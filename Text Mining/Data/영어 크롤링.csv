"January 26, 2020",Bernard Reis,1,"Completely frustrating experience. Paid extra money to get the air conditioner with connectivity, but it just doesn't work 9/10 times I try to use it. When it gets to connect to the device, it takes less than a minute to get disconnected again. Tried reinstalling the app, cleared the cache, reset router, replaced the router, but nothing works. Again, I'm completely frustrated.",7
"January 18, 2020",Gordon Inman,2,"Some good features, but this app isn't very smart. You would think once you connect to the device it would give the UI/UX for your specific device. I connected my new stove/oven, but the image used to represent my stove doesn't match my stovetop burner layout. The directions for the oven remote start are written generically to try to fit any product; ""look to see if you have this."" If they would put some effort into personalizing the experience to the device you purchased, I'd rate this higher.",8
"January 18, 2020",MrDurma,4,"This app works perfectly, it allowed us to download many more cycles for our Washer/Dryer. It really has cool features and we don't have any problems with it but there is one thing which is kind of bothering, in the Power Monitoring section it doesn't show almost any useful info about how much electricity has been consumed, it just shows ""rating?"" From 0 to 5. How are we supposed to know how much kWh is 1 and how much kWh is 5? That would make my rating and experience 5/5 :D",2
"January 26, 2020",K Kostas,3,"Good but not great for an app by LG. Not the most user interface friendly, and few adjustments by user. I downloaded it to add a washer/dryer extra cycles and it does not have some cycles that would be nice to have (like a soak cycle), they are just a bit different, and I can just have the same cycles by adjusting the temp and such on the existing ones.",1
"January 17, 2020",Greg Evans,3,"App is useful but limited and requires some updates. The WiFi setup took longer than it should, because the app was not clear about which button turned WiFi on. I had to reference the user's manual to turn on WiFi. I was using this app to use the smart analysis function. All tests pass, but I still have problems getting my new dishwasher to consistently complete a wash cycle. Ideally there would be a test for any component that is causing the dishwasher to stop.",1
"January 5, 2020",Ranelle Lucina,2,"I was able to connect to my lg appliances for the first few months. After an upgrade, all appliances show as disconnected, and I can no longer reconnect to my home wi-fi. 1/4/20 update: I emailed as requested, because after reinstalling the app, and resetting my router, I'm still not able to connect to all my appliances. There were a couple I was able to connect to, but it took several painful attempts. It keeps saying there are issues connecting with their servers.",0
"January 5, 2020",Tom,2,"LG air conditioning - Bugs are mostly fixed. I hope they don't break it again. Now if they would make the app actually useful. Please let me set temperature, mode and fan speed for scheduling. When I set repeating schedule I don't know what the temperature will be a week from now. There's no way to set it to all AUTO because this setting is pretty much useless. Time alone just doesn't cut it.",6
"January 19, 2020",Carlos Sanz,2,"It is not really helpful with my washing machine. Only predesigned programs can be chosen in the app and it does not let you make any modification of temp, spin and so on. It would also be nice to start a second program like spin or dry after washing, but for that you need to go back to your machine and select the remote start again... I just like receiving a notification when my laundry is done but, apart from that, not much value for washers...",9
"January 6, 2020",Yun Gi Jang,1,"Right now the app version is V3.0.1700001 and it seems that I can't connect my vacuum cleaner, at least for me it doesn't appear in the screen. However the app tells me that products like styler, oven, washer, including vacuum cleaner can only be added in standby mode, what does it mean?",3
"January 10, 2020",Ray Gozo,3,So far so good. (For Washing Machines). Some minor glitches... Other than OK. What I would like to to see ADDED to the downloadable cycles (in future update) is more TIME OPTION for the TIME DELAY programme. Currently you can only set it up from 3 to 19 hrs. An 1hr time delay would help a lot. Thanks LG.,1
"January 10, 2020",Birdski Bird,1,"Wifi connectivity is horrible. I purchased a washing machine with wifi connectivity. This app is absolutely horrible at doing that. I have tried all the trouble shooting / router configurations that I could with this, and get an error that the machine is off, and there is no internet connection available. I will end up returning this machine and getting another competitor machine who's app will work. Get it together LG, I will not be a returning customer . All of my other wifi items work fine",2
"January 20, 2020",Noushin K,3,"The app as it stands, doesn't crash, and works, but alongside a WiFi apppliance has MAJOR shortcomings: 1) Can't turn on remotely!!!! If I have to manually press the on/off botton on applianaces, the wifi feature loses appeal.the app becomes more of toy that a tool. 2) doesn't allow you to setup a time to start any of my appliances. I should be able to set the timezone/time in the app, and then given it's connected to internet, the machine should be able to turn on at the specified time).",5
"January 2, 2020",Bob Rose,5,"Works Great! Didn't think I would like this app working with my washer and dryer as much as I have. It updated the software right away on both the washer and dryer, then has worked flawlessly. I'm able to monitor both while running, pause cycles, remote start, and best of all, get reminders when each load is finished and ready for attention.",3
"January 24, 2020",Sheena Pakanati,1,"Requires unnecessary permissions to run at all (location, phone calls). App won't launch without these permissions, which are irrelevant to the app's functionality. Update: The developer's response unfortunately does not make much sense. There are a number of other ways for the app to function without requesting or requiring these invasive permissions (and many other apps manage to do so). As others have noted, some other apps will ask for permissions and simply disable advanced features if the permissions aren't granted, but the LG app won't run at all even though none of its features *truly* require these call, media, location permissions. Hopefully LG will note the many customer reviews objecting to the permission requests and make some changes.",0
"January 14, 2020",Damien Hill,2,"When the app works its great, but half the time I find it doesn't connect to the wifi. I have checked my wifi and even when I'm receiving the best possible signal, it still won't connect to my TV. Instead I have downloaded the other LG app 'LG TV Plus' which I am guessing it's the same creator?",0
"January 11, 2020",Jason Powell,1,App push notification does not work for letting you know when wash cycle is done. I think it's worked a few times when the cycle is actually done but most times it's hours later when you get the push. Remote start is a joke because you have to turn on remote start for you to be able to remotely start it.... Only reasons I got this washer and it doesn't work. Won't be buying any future lg products.,0
"January 11, 2020",Rebecca Shapard,2,Pain in the butt to get washer and dryer connected to the app...App itself isn't very user friendly...App just suggested updating so I did the update...Went in the app to set up a delay wash cycle and it says that I don't have any appliances connected... Now I have to start the whole process over of getting connected to the app 🙄,1
"January 25, 2020",Martin Petder,4,"Functional app that allows to run washing machine remotely with standard settings. Cannot modify programs like is possible on the machine itself, but can see the planned ending time of delay that is not possible on the machine. Too slow to get connection via cloud (has no direct connectivity) and quite often shows wrong information at the beginning so you have to wait for the update.",1
"January 27, 2020",Liliana Ruiz,2,"The app is kinda useless, unless you have to know exactly when your dishwasher is done. I was under the impression I could turn on the dishwasher from my phone and change the cycles. All I can do is see if the dishwasher is running and how much time is left. I haven't had any issues with the dishwasher yet, so I haven't had to use the customer support part yet.",0
"January 3, 2020",Adrian Macneil,1,Super privacy invasive. Requires permission to view all your call history just to open the app. Fails to open the app if you reject it. Then it requires your date of birth to sign up. Completely unnecessary to require these. Edit: Developer response is unacceptable. It would be trivial to ask for my country rather than requiring invasive permissions such as viewing all call history.,1
"January 20, 2020",Joy Wallar,2,"This app is helpful with my dryer and was helpful with my washer. I don'tknow if its an app issue or a washer issue. I found that my frustration with my washer is not unique. It set-up with the app immediately after receiving the machine. It continue to work well for several days and then all the sudden, it disconnected and will not connect. My dryer has stayed stable with connection. I have tried the trouble shooting, resetting, uninstalling app, unplugging machine, etc. So frustrating.",1
"January 18, 2020",Milovan Predojevic,2,"AC interface wont start after the new update. Just giving me a msg Device wont start, try again later...I would go back to old app if appstore gives this option but no. Dont update the apps if it breaks how it has been working in the previous version. I ve tried reinstalling and restarting the app. Phone is Xperia UltraA1",0
"November 27, 2019",Luis NY,3,"App works kind of ok... Add appliances is very easy and so far it worked flawlessly... Adjusting the settings can be some challenging as it most of the times did not saved the settings on the first try... Washer, dryer (the ones I own) could have a better and longer usage history logs, including water usage, day and time it ran, along with the items it already logs, for the refrigerator a history of defrost, ice production and water usage also with the items already logged.",6
"November 27, 2019",bruce bradbury,1,"Almost completely useless! The only thing useful the app does is sometimes it let's you know the dryer is done. Sometimes! You can't turn the dryer on remotely which means you can't restart if you couldn't get the clothes out after the first cycle. Also, the dryer doesn't actually get the clothes dry with normal cycle. The dryer and the app are both a waste of money!",6
"January 25, 2020",John Landa,1,"Hire some decent programmers. At the very least publish a decent writeup that ""works"" for each product. I won't even get into questioning why the app needs the BS permissions it asks for. I have 4 major LG appliances. This fridge is the first with WiFi. This sad excuse of an app will make me rethink another LG purchase. --------------- Update After 3 go rounds with support over connection issues I am being totally ignored. Sent them every piece of info they requested. Crickets! 1 LOST CUSTOMER",2
"January 9, 2020",Greg,1,Just purchased my LG LFX28566S. Downloaded the ThinQ app on my android and cannot get it to connect. Using a 2.4 network and it will reach 60% and then times out. I have tried a number of times with the same result. Very disappointed. Do I return the fridge as alerts are one of the reasons I purchased this product.,4
"January 30, 2020",mersudin saric,1,"With app is possible only to switch on and off the air conditioner. Other functions are not available because each time appears a message ""try again to restore normal operation of device"" and the app goes back to basic function: switch on/off and current temperature.",0
"January 19, 2020",BandarKeto,1,"10/12/2019: For the last 3 days, cant even connect to the app, everytime i log in it says failed to connect to server.

"December 1, 2019",Cyndy Cook,5,"Very good...once I made sure my refrigerator was registered. I had forgotten that I hadn't done so when I first got it so the diagnostics wouldn't perform. After going through the registration, the app worked perfectly! Within a matter of seconds, it was done and over with. Everything is in perfect running order, just the way it should be. Good app. Suggestion, tho...have a reminder at the beginning of the app to make sure products have been registered before using it.",7
"December 8, 2019",Chris Nesbit,3,"It is a very cool app to use with your various LG devices, but I feel the app could be designed better. The way everything is explained for the app could be better. I did not realize that more than one person could connect to it until I began experimenting with setting it all up again with someone else's phone.",2
"December 28, 2019",Mark Weeks,1,"Downloaded it to work with my LG TV and wouldn't connect for no reason, then randomly decided to connect. Sometimes it will connect to it and other times it won't. There's nothing wrong with the internet, TV, or my phone. I've followed all the steps to connect it to Alexa and that won't find it, even when it's connected. Rubbish app and a waste of time.",4
"January 9, 2020",Brendon Serack,1,"Unable to add tv. Tv says the phone was added. Phone gives me an error ""the network information can not be sent to your tv.

"January 15, 2020",Bianca,1,"I really don't understand the need of so many authorizations and terms. I don't want to make an account or allow the app to have access to my personal information in my phone. I think I could have options in app if chosing country and langage for example. Even my partner approving and authorizing everything, we couldn't find the option we wanted the most as personalized cycles.",4
"January 27, 2020",Erik,1,"WAY, WAY TOO MUCH PERMISSIONS!

Pretty far overreach here LG!",0
"December 6, 2019",Ratko Dakic,1,"Some time this app is not usable on android, when I want to set new temp for my AC always I got message to try again and app return me to home screen of this very bad app! On iphone this option working normal! Also, you must add option to schedule temperature at some part of day (auto change temp), now we can just auto power on/off AC but we can't set program to auto adjust temperature at some part of day like 08-12 - 23°, 12-16 - 25°, 16-08 - 20° etc. You must add this option!!!",4
"November 29, 2019",Krystian Wiatr,3,"I use this app mostly as TV remote. It's okay, but lacking some basic functionality. It cannot power on the TV - my alexa can do it. There is no keyboard - arguably the most important tv app feature. Roku app had that working 5+ years ago. Keep up the good work, and hopefully we will see some updates soon.",4
"December 25, 2019",Freddie Appleby,1,"Used to work with the washer with no issues. Then after the last update or so it just immediately signed me out and tells me my login details are incorrect. I use a password manager, so no they aren't but whatever I go and reset it and sure enough on the latest update we have the same situation again, signed out and needs reseting again. I shouldn't need to be logged in to just to use nfc anyway so uninstalled. Maybe they will fix it at some point.",4
"December 31, 2019",David Fridley,3,"I can't believe how hard it was to connect to my washer the first time. The written directions just left me guessing, but to be fair I did notice that the app was changing too a new wifi SSID to find and setup the washer. More progress information would give do better to set expectations. Never sit there and leave the user wondering what's going on for minutes. There's a red key crossed out on my washer. Makes me think it's missing the wifi security key - but then it couldn't be talking.",2
"January 27, 2020",datta sarma,5,"As usual LG never diappointed me. Please follow Cyndy Cook suggestion below review. Make sure your appliances are registered. Latest update (i have written this review on 12/22/2019) is perfect. My special request to LG is please include Energy Ctrl option in next update (80%, 60%, 40%) in ThinQ app please...This ensures no need of remote control in hand but we can control remotely with app. Thank you in advance for considering my request in next update.",0
"January 18, 2020",Slenda Mon,1,"Be neat if it worked more than twice! Kist keepa freezing not to mention the only way to truly exit the app is to force it to stop running in the background. no option in the app to use a keyboard in order to type on smart tvs within apps or say to sign in. Without that feature for tvs one is better off with the lg tv plus app, even though it also lacks the same thing.",1
"January 22, 2020",Claus Jensen,1,"Completely useless app. Wanted to use the Download Cycle for a Tag On machine. The cycles you can download are things like ""Full load"", ""New clothes"" etc. You cannot set or see what the temperature, spin cycle etc will be. In short, completely useless.",1
"January 24, 2020",J Chapin,1,"App won't even start. Complains that my phone is rooted, no idea why it cares. Edit: support admitted to me that their app is spyware, and tries to collect a list of installed apps. If you have root related apps installed, their app reports it and dies. Dev keeps insisting their spyware is acceptable. It's not, nor is it acceptable that they attempt to dictate what I do on my hardware.",1
"January 24, 2020",Grant Gould,1,"Required unreasonable permissions (all-time location, phone calls) refuses to run if they are not granted. My washing machine should not need permissions, and no app should be unable to run in a degraded mode without permissions. (per reply below: There's no reason the app should need to get country from sim rather than asking user, or indeed from the location permission it also asks for. Equally there is no reason it should not accept location-only-when-running rather than location-always. Especially for an app with ads, location-always and phone permissions are obviously unreasonable)",2
"December 29, 2019",Mathew,1,"server failed to connect, no response from the server. Try again later. App is useless, tried all the usual stuff like delete app cache/data, uninstalled and reinstalled, app has not worked in months due to error above, tried on home WiFi, 4g mobile data, no issues with other apps, using galaxy s10+. Also although I did allow access, why on earth does this app need telephone permission and location permission absolute joke of a app and company. Will never buy an LG product again.",2
"January 13, 2020",John Angelillo,5,The app has been working fine the last couple of months they've worked out a few issues with the reconnection issues and that was very important because it was very frustrating so. So making that statement at this point I have to give it a 5-star rating!,0
"December 9, 2019",Emil Kreutzman,1,"Everything about this app feels a bit 2013 and non-polished. I guess it works, but it's not very slick or pleasing to use. Also, why does it show the weather?? Lowered review by one star because of all the additional permissions. Edit December 2019: apparently this app reads my location in the background. Great, 1 star.",4
"December 3, 2019",Jason Johnson,1,Demands permanent access to Phone Calls and Location permissions at startup and refuses to run if permission is denied or restricted to when the app is running. Neither of these is necessary for any reasonable functionality of the app. Today my refrigerator quit working. It defrosted everything in my freezer. NO notification from the app. Manually running diagnostics in the app says everything is fine and working even though the freezer is currently over 40F when it should be 0F.,8
"December 19, 2019",Gerry Go,2,App is disappointing. It lacks a lot of features I expected when I chose an LG combo washing machine with WiFi. My wishlist: 1. Better controls over the settings on remote start. 2. Notification on start of cycle when using delay end time 3. Logging of actual time from start to finish of washing and drying 4. Better energy monitoring. It should show the actual watt-hr usage instead of just icons. This feature is so useless that Ihad to use a separate power meter for this purpose.,4
"January 9, 2020",Bec Smith,5,"Very helpful, failed first attempt, but had to close fridge to restart diagnosis, then work properly and said nothing wrong, just fridge left open for to long it told us that the fridge had been open 41 times in the last day. Probably why nothing seemed cold.",0
"January 14, 2020",Michael Hewartson,2,You set the washer and dryer for remote start by pressing a button on the machine. This renders the option almost useless. I essentially paid $200 extra for Wi-Fi capable appliances just to get an alert on my phone that a load of laundry is done.,0
"January 12, 2020",Jacob Sylvia,2,Eh. It's not so great. With a washer and dryer it takes an extremely long time to get the values updated. The washer also drops offline all the time which makes the app completely useless but LG refuses to acknowledge the issue.,0
"December 30, 2019",Orland Louie Reyes,2,"This is below average compared to other competitors like Samsung. I bought the C9 assuming that their equivalent ThinQ has the capabilities to add family members to control LG devices. Unfortunately, this is not the case and have not found a workaround. Also, my voice assistant can't control the TV directly because it needs to go through a gateway (ThinQ) to accept commands.",4
"December 22, 2019",Lucas Araujo do Nascimento,1,Horrible. I hoped that I could type the text at the app. But is just the same functions from the remote at the phone. At least I the voice could be available. 100MB and is worse than an IR app that I already use. Seriously... Should have bought another brand of TV. Have always been happy with Panasonic. Will go back to it at next TV.,2
"December 29, 2019",Michael Derhammer,1,"Product status is slow. It doesn't always connect. I logged out of the app and back in and lost all of my connected products! Also, still haven't found a way to do multi-user so my wife can use a separate account to monitor the same products. Horrible app. Will not be buying LG ever again. Worst application experience from what I use to consider a top-tier competitor in the appliance space.",2
"December 11, 2019",John C,1,"Spent over an hour, and can't get my new washer dryer to connect to the internet. They do connect to wifi, but without registering themselves to the LG server they delete themselves from the app. I have done everything I can think of on my end, disabling firewalls and such on my router, but nothing works.

Plese fix it developers....",2
"December 18, 2019",Villi Mag,1,Edit: A year has gone since I gave my review of this app and the LG TrueStream washing machine. And still there's no wool program to be downloaded. This must be the most useless app and feature for a washing machine in washing machine history. Sales trick made to grab your money. What washing machine doesn't offer a wool program anyway? It's stupid. And the washing machine and this app doesn't even have a wool program. Neither preinstalled on the machine nor to download via the app.,6
"December 22, 2019",Szymon Buhajczuk,1,"The app no longer works due to overreaching permission requests. Since the update it requires permissions to make calls (which I refuse). Most apps simply disable features if you deny permissions to specific things. This one won't launch *at all* if you deny it ability to make calls.

"December 5, 2019",Janna Oakfellow-Pushee,5,"Although it may sound silly to some, I actually enjoy the polite notification that my Washer and Dryer hit me up with.

Definitely would not recommend unless the dev teams make so major usability updates!!",5
"December 6, 2019",Jan Streit,1,In current version app doesn't show current consumption of the electricity in Air Condition setting (monitoring). Previous UI was much better. Additionally app (account) cannot be link to Google Home. It doesn't work almost an year and LG really doesn't care to much. Therefor I cannot recommend to buy LG product anymore.,8
"November 28, 2019",Chris Cavanaugh,5,App is a necessity. My dishwasher was having issues and would stop during cycles and I would need to restart it. Sometimes it would not start at all.

"December 16, 2019",Brenton Faddis,1,It's not linking to alexa very well! Ever since their last stupid system update last week whenever I ask lg to change to a hdmi number on their smart tv IT JUST PULLS UP WHAT TIME THE HDMI NUMBER IS ON TV FOR GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS on the tv via alexa!

"January 15, 2020",Michael Harrison,2,The app doesn't keep time with the washer and dryer. And I can't remote start the washer snd dryer!! WTH!

Have options. Where hey I left clothes in my dryer let me start a wrinkle free cycle. There many different things that you can do to prove this app. Email me. We can chat and I show you innovation.,6
"October 27, 2019",Karthik Kumar S,4,"Good! But could be better than this! Overall the app experience is good. But I'm only using it with the Washer. It's good that only after enabling ""Remote Start"" manually from the machine, it can be controlled remotely. Not sure if LG could override this too remotely. It would be helpful to know the power consumption in Watts rather than as a symbol. Real time product based widget could be more helpful. Server maintainence could be known only after opening the app. Could use push notifications.",0

It changes it to 8:30 to 5:30. No matter how many times I try to change it. And if I try to select a different time, it changes it to another completely different time. Garbage app waste of space on my phone.",6
"September 26, 2019",Johnny Westgate,2,"Meh. It covers the basics. It's slow to update the status of appliances, usually telling me they're offline first. Needs explanations of cycles. Is Bedding heavy blankets and duvets? Or is it sheets and pillowcases? Push notifications don't expand to show additional information, like the time it was sent, so you can't know if that note is for a new end of cycle or from one 2 hours ago that you forgot to dismiss. And I want to be able to set a clock start time since we pay time of use hydro.",3
"August 23, 2019",Chad Grashel,1,"Push notifications sometimes work but most of the time do not. Everything was great until updates were made back in the early spring and LG can't get it right. Adding this. Why does LG need access to photos, media files, and call history? You can't upload anything to their app. It looks like data collection. If you have an issue, you have to call, email, and upload docs outside of the app. Reviewing cycle settings makes no sense. Simply, this is not a user-friendly app.",7

Nothing to complicated there, until you find out the only temperatures you see on the app (or the fridge door for that matter) are what LG call 'target temperatures', you can adjust the 'target temperatures' but you have no idea if the fridge freezer has achieved them, at no point does the fridge door or app display the current internal temperatures The fridge freezer itself is great but what is the point of the app? Surely the most fundamental information you want from a wifi enabled fridge freezer is the inside temperatures, I understand that if I leave the door open it will send me an alert but come on is that it, I would not leave the door open anyway and unless the cat develops ninja skills and starts raiding the fridge overnight it is not going to happen.

Won't even allow timed dry, and has to be re-enabled on the dryer's control panel every time you use it.  Most of the downloadable programs are the opposite of what I want, and LG forbids you to create your own.  RATIONALE/USE CASE:  Because high heat is so damaging to clothing, and because dryers (especially our LG dryer) are so bad at sensing humidity, I've found the _only_ way to get properly dry clothes without damage or wrinkles is to run _several_ timed dry sessions with rest periods in between.  First low or medium, then a rest to allow moisture to redistribute, then a low immediately followed by air dry to cool and avoid wrinkles.  It works great manually, and an app _should_ be great for doing this with fewer trips to the laundry room, but LG's app forbids this usage.",3

"August 10, 2019",Nova Saradjian,2,The problem with this app is the time it takes to establish a connection with our AC units. It's quicker to get up and grab the normal control and switch it on. Our LAN and WiFi network uses corporate equipment and all our other devices and Smart system works perfectly. LG you need to sort this performance lag out as there is no point using the app,0

Very often the unit will completely disconnect and be uncontrollable from app. Previous smart wifi air conditioning controller from Flair never had any issues like this. Wish my old unit still worked i would go back to it. 10/10 would NOT buy an LG again.,2

Prepare to be interrupted as you toast your friend. Amazon has laundry detergent on sale! These push ads cannot be disabled without disabling the only useful features this app has. Neither of these consumer hostile policies is necessary. The smart app on for my GE appliances neither tracks me nor pushes ads. LG, if you're reading this: I just bought two new big screen TVs.

Why does this app need access to my location at all times? LG doesn't need to know when I am home or when I am out somewhere else just to see the status of my laundry. If I turn the location permission off, the app stops working. In addition, LG seems to have frequent updates to the terms of service that you must agree to or the app will not work.

The food expiration feature is a great add, however, I believe the current design is inefficient for managing food items.   The current process: 1. Open Manage Food 2. Click Add Food button 3. Locate a food item by category or search for. If you don't find an item you can create a new user item.  4. Add item to your refrigerator or freezer area 5. Navigate back to the Manage Food page  6. Locate the added item within my items 7. Open the item and add the expiration date.   Whew!! That's a lot of work to add one item and the expiration date.  I recommend you add barcode scanning functionality and the following process: 1. Open Manage Food 2. Click Add Food by Barcode (new feature) 3. View item details, select refrigerator or freezer area and set expiration date from this page.   Done! This would be a much better user experience.

I also noted like others have stated that if the units are off and I open the app I can't turn on the units with this app. It will state next to the image the product unit is off or it is not connected to the Internet (which it is because I just connected it).

So far not impressed with LG.,0

I can download new washing programs or set the temperature, and the notifications are a nice touch. Wifi diagnostics for the fridge always fails, but audio diagnostics works and it helped me figure out that the fridge was in defrosting mode so that's why I couldn't hear it working.

"July 3, 2019",Jeff Larkin,1,"Although it explains why, it asks for unreasonable permissions like making and managing phonecalls that it should be able to function without. After that there's no functionality without creating an LG account. Just not worth it to me.  Update: The developer's response to my review just proves my point as to why I uninstalled the app. Asking to be able to make/manage phone calls to determine my country is an abuse of that permission and violation of my privacy. Same with requesting fine-grained location just to access WiFi. If they can't trust me to tell them what country I live in, why should I trust them with such broad permissions? This might be a good app, but is burdened with permissions issues that make it not worth installing in my opinion. Your mileage may vary though.",1

If you're considering an internet-enabled appliance, I would recommend NOT going with LG's SmartThinq platform.   This app is as basic as it gets. Shows my washer and dryer, and ony updates the status after having the app screen open for at least 30 seconds (I know this because the status doesn't update until after the screen has dimmed). Push notifications often fail to show up (yes, I've disabled battery management and other Android issues that can block notifications), and even when they do show up, there's no action that can be triggered by them.  The ONLY use for this app is to ask Google how much time is left on my laundry. Flash your smart-home's lights when it's done? Not possible. Integrate with IFTTT? Only if you're in the United States (and even then, I can't speak to its utility, since I'm not).  There is no support for third-party integrations (e.g. API access for non-partners), this app is nearly useless, and the incredible power of the internet to connect things and make them talk to one another is actively ignored by LG.",2

I'm a tech professional and enthusiast. I'm not breaking any laws, defrauding any companies, or misusing any products. Root access isn't any indication that I might be. Worst of all even if those things were true, it wouldn't even be relevant to your product, so the only logical takeaway from you blocking root users is that you just don't want our business. Well, congratulations, your wish is granted. I'm no longer a customer, and as a tech professional, I'll stop recommending your products for institutional use.",3

Compared to a previous Hoover washer dryer and their app (it was awful) I would never go back. I can ask it to do something and it just gets on with it. I would add though that they need to simplify the initial pairing to the app with the washer dryer. Harder than it needed to be. All fine since of course!,0
"January 28, 2020",Gaby Mayo,1,"Update 2: emailed as suggested below, after a week one reply came, promptly responded to, and now nothing after another few weeks. Terrible customer service. Update: Verfication email came through aaprox 4 hours later, by which time the link did not work. Have attempted to resend now multiple times but no email coming through again - still 1 Star! Verification email does not come through. Attempted 4 times now, but can't verify my new account so cannot use the app with my new LG gear",2
"December 11, 2019",Pierre Louis TODESCO,3,Finally the compatibility with Google is there! The bad point remain that only few useless parameters are available. I was expecting at least two real temperature (fridge and freezer) with display between selected and real. ON & OFF timing (Graph) of the compressor related to the ambient (local weather) would be also a good point to determine the influence of the selected temperature versus the consumption of the device.,1
"January 6, 2020",Jeff Russell,1,"Previous issue with the app being unstable is fine. However, all I am able to do now is put in pre-set washer profiles as opposed to having any real control over how the washer runs. Tried to uninstall and reinstall, but it continuously forced my phone to restart. Couldn't get the app open once. I miss your old laundry app.",0
"January 28, 2020",Wesley Fan,1,PERMISSIONS! Not only can I not put the setting in my dryer manually (for example theres no way for me to use ultra low and damp dry) but they make me download the app which apparently needs location information and to access my calls? The location settings have NOTHING to do with connecting bluetooth to the dryer and im not giving your app access to my phone and contacts. Theres ZERO reason for this. Their dish washers are also terrible. Its like they dont even try out their products beforehand,0

"October 29, 2019",Steve,1,"This app is a waste of time. I purchased a new LG washer/dryer last week. The Dryer will connect, the washing machine won't. I have tried repeatedly. I also contacted LG support a week ago and they didn't bother to reply. If you are looking for a ""smart"" machine, don't get an LG. Other than that, the washing machine works well but the app is useless.",4
"October 29, 2019",Jack,3,Unfathomable that a major international brand could produce such a horrible non-functional app.  Your developers do not know what they are doing.  Please hire a new team to fix this.  God knows you have the $$$ to do so.,0
"October 10, 2019",Jenn C,4,Horrible just horrible bought the washer and dryer and can't even download any cycles like I'm suppose to be able can't use all features that the washer and dryer say they have. if I had of known Would never have purchased the washer and dryer set customer service is horrible as well and now I'm stuck with a set that I can't fully use. I've had April and it's now Aug with no update to this app to make the features of my washer and dryer work so frustrated.,1

Plus with the latest version fan speed no longer stays illuminated so you don't know what settings it's on and at the bottom where additional settings are it just has ""@AC_MAIN_WIND_MODE"" on the button.

Now, will wait to see if this half-baked app will actually link with my LG product once it arrives tomorrow! If not, I'll be sorry I even bought it!!  UPDATE: Still love my (manually operated) LG air conditioner, but HATE the fact that LQ refuses to fix this problem. They should warn potential customers BEFORE purchase that their smart app is hobbled in this way.

The AC still becomes unreachable by both Smart Thinq and Alexa the minute we power it down.Aside from my AC frequently going offline and having to register in the app, the app works. One thing I can't understand is why the developers would direct you to update Android System Webview, when Android switched to Chrome in 2016. You can't update that and you can't enable it either.",0

"April 28, 2019",Lilredrydinghud Foxless,5,I like that I am notified on my cell phone when washer & Dryer are done (set is in garage so I don't hear it) and will forget to remove clothes....Now I get them into dryer right away and out right away no wrinkles from setting too long. YES I like this app. update: I'm still very much enjoying this app! Would like to have washer/dryer inside house but not an option and being notified on my Watch & phone is absolutely awesome😁 Always know when laundry is done.,0

How do they know how its working on our phones. Mine says ""won't work on a rooted phone"" and my phone isn't rooted. So there is clearly an error coding, morons. Stop saying its an end user issue when dev's have gotten pretty lazy in the past decade. How much were you compensated to lie about quality of software?",7

"November 23, 2018",David Sacerdote,1,"While the initial version of the app couldn't run at all on my phone, LG eventually shipped a working version of the app after about six weeks. This was really annoying because they intentionally broke the predecessor app, so features weren't available in that time. The updated app (12/16/2016) still asks for way too many permissions, like access to my contacts list, and access to my SMS messages, and requires that you agree to a long and legalese-filled terms of use and privacy policy. Both the long list of permissions and the crazy legalese are completely unacceptable, so this app will not get to live on any phone of mine. 11/22/2018 app refuses to run without unreasonable permission requests. Washing machine control doesn't need permission to send my photos to the manufacturer.",1

Previous review: A year later this app is still worse than the old one was for my LG washer. The old app had laundry stats, features, explanations of downloadable cycles. (Even the paper manual contains basic info on the standard cycles. Why wouldn't you offer some explanation as to what a cycle actually does, not just what LG thinks it will be good for?). This app is missing necessary functions and information. It's sparse. And just not up to par with other current apps for smart products. LG, why won't you give this app the same functionality for washing machines as the old app had?",4

could replicate turning off this switch by just turning off my Cellular

like a charm. Hopefully this helps those who are having issues. The problem 
is that your phone switches from the device it's connected to and it wants 
to connect back to your WiFi and link it there but what it does if you 
don't turn off your cellular data is it connects to the internet there and 
it looks for your device but it's not going to find it on your cell network

Well I can't get my Samsung Galaxy 9+ to work with the washer. I tried everything.

I have a washer that the program will not work with and am extremely disappointed. Comments were unavailable via my cell phone so I am commenting using my laptop.

Why would you need my location to control the AC over wifi? The developer's responses is nonsense. I returned the LG AC unit and bought a GE instead.

because I can't seem to edit existing washes(like changing the temp, spin 
spin speed etc) which you can do on the machine itself! I also can't see a 
way to create custom washes from scratch, which I'd a shame! If there's a 
way to do the above from the app, then let me know and I'll change my 
rating! I know why they are required but I'm also not keen on the

App whatsoever. I was very happy. But as of this past weekend I was forced 
to upgrade to this app now and having all sorts of issues connecting to my 
AC / Heat mini split. What once was a very easy process of managing my 
units has turned into a nightmare. I constantly get errors saying that my 
product is unavailable or connection cancelled. What makes matters worse is 
these units are installed in a secondary home so remote capability is 
paramount. Will not buy LG products any longer based on this experience. 
Sorry I made this mistake up front. You live, you learn. April 30 update - 
have sinced fixed the issues above and added 2 more devices to control. 
Easy setup and love the app and its design. You need to power off the 
circuit for the install of the wifi module you are installing. Then it will 
be recognized in the setup. Working as advertised so all is well!! May 23 
2018 Update... App sucks again after updates. I'm controlling 5 Wifi 
modules for 5 Mini-split AC units. Takes way to long to pull the data for 
each unit and then gives a ""network unstable message"" after I select a unit 
to manage. After this it needs to refresh all 5 units and takes forever

permissions - all I wanted was the status of my washing why do you need 
device storage, contacts, camera, microphone, etc just for that! The only 
big thing I can understand you might need is location and that's at a push. 
On the comments LG have left for other people who have complained about 
this; usim info to get then country - do you really need to do that? Can't 
you just ask the user for their country or use the location service which 
you have also asked for permission for? And storage to determine if you can 
install the app?? Huh? How can the app run something before it's installed 
to determine if it can be installed..? Play store manages all that. sorry 
but I'm a software developer and it all doesn't sound right to me... Anyway 
now its setup I can view the status of my washing but push notifications 
never work. I tried a plan b of connecting the account to Google home, 
first issue is you can't use the standard LG account I setup instead you 
need to link to your Google account. But after going through the hassle of 
registering again with my Google account and linking the washer to it all 
that I get in google assistant is 'LG isn't responding at the moment' :-( I 
then realised you can link the lg account to if this then that (ITTT) wow I 
thought this would be cool, so gave that a go... But I can't even link the 
accounts up for that I just get ""device does not match region settings. 
change region settings"" when I sign in to the account, ahh so frustrating! 
So basically it's a fail. LG seem to have had lots of really good ideas but 
the technical implementation is really disappointing. Hopefully given time 
then it will all get looked at but it's really not up to scratch at the 
moment, I'm amazed it all got through their QA process! Sorry LG Update -

left. I can see the extra programs to download, but during the washing

took me hours to figure out that my ""touch button panel"" wasn't a ""touch

general. It's slow to start up (on a Snapdragon 835 with 6GB RAM and 100Mb

mean my appliance is in the wrong region? Does this mean my IP geolocation 
is showing me in the wrong region? This message is so obtuse and unhelpful. 
Additionally, I don't know how to take a reasonable action based on the 
suggestion of this error. I am an American who speaks English, but I often 
work and live overseas. My home base is in the USA, but I spend most of the 
year in various locations overseas with corresponding appliances in each 
country. My phone is a Google Pixel 2 XL with Project Fi, which I use 
because of its great international roaming capable SIM card. Each appliance 
is set to the region where it resides, and would be detected as such by IP 
geolocation as well. Does LG expect that I change my phone's region 
settings every time I fly to a different country? Does LG expect that I 
have a different phone for each country? Does LG expect that I set 
appliances in other countries to the US region? Does LG expect that I 
create a different account for each region? All of these solutions seem 
unnecessarily complex and inconvenient, and, combined with the unclear 
error which doesn't really tell me where the problem is, deserving of one 
star. LG, either fix your system to more easily support users with multiple 
residences, or provide a clear solution on how to use SmartThinQ in my 
situation. If you can help me with that, then I can actually review the 
usefulness of this app.",1

It's absurd to have to register to use an app to access devices only on my own LAN, but it's doubly absurd to have to register twice through the same company, and it's downright terrible that there is no internal data sharing at LG.

It connected with other appliances so I knew it wasn't an nfc issue with my smartphone. Fed up of having to manipulate cycles for my wools (surprising it isn't a standard option anyway) I decided to give it another go. I downloaded the app again and then when it came to pairing with the phone it was instant (I placed it in the same place as last time so defo wasn't me). Clearly the developers have listened to customers and updated the app. I found a wool cycle and downloaded it, phone didn't even have to be right on top of the machine either just hovering nearby, and the cycle reset on the washer and was ready to go. This is exactly what I wanted so you deserve the newly updated 5 star rating guys 👌  I'm sure there are other features too but this was my bug bear not getting it connect and it's now fixed so I'm looking forward to seeing what other features I can use :)",2

Your response, pasted below, is grossly inadequate.    ""LG Electronics, Inc. February 8, 2018 Dear.Jamie I'm sorry for the trouble. About permission, we don't collect any information. And we're in progress of developing the new version that explain the reason why the app need the permission. Please wait.. And I'm sorry again.""  The answer is that your developers are lazy.  There is NO reason that your app needs all this access simply to download cycles and remotely control the machines.  The only reason you'd ever need that is for troubleshooting.  I know it makes life easier for your devs to make it mandatory instead of actually developing the app in such a way to make it less intrusive, but that's what they get paid to do.  Remove that requirement and you'll have a fair number of happier customers.  Further, I agree that the app, so far anyway, seems fairly useless for anything beyond downloading cycles.  Perhaps when I have a problem that needs to be troubleshot remotely I'll find it useful, but for now, no.",1

Like this comment so we can get some support rather than an automated answer, the highest rated comment which shows first says it's all fine, which it clearly isn't. Many people having issues and an app rating of 2! Seriously LG???  Original post:  Just bought an LG Titan washing machine with apparently Smart Thinq technology. Doesn't work at all, the app immediately closes as soon as you try to open it, using a clean Honor 6x android 6 install, same as I see another person in comments using (without success too) Not rooted so that isn't the problem. Found an earlier version of the app, v1.8 which actually shows the app loading screen but then notifies of an update to 1.92 and won't continue further without updating, so catch 22. Really annoyed as this was part of the reason for buying this machine. Please fix this app else I'll be switching to a Samsung machine. Unacceptable.  Edit: As already stated, the app simply won't open. Tried via my Honor 6x phone running Android 6.0 Emui 4.1.3 Kirin 655. My Samsung Tab running Android 4.4, none of the devices are rooted. The app flashes a white screen and promptly disappears, refusing to run. Earlier versions actually start to load but then informs of an update and won't continue until updating to the latest version, which obviously doesn't work.",1

Nope, have to plan on using remote start in advance and turn the machine to that setting and then the machine turns itself off if you don't start it within a certain time frame.

I literally still have to physically load my clothes into the washer before I use the app. I thought the point of the app was to make life easier, instead I have to get up, separate my lights from the colors and load soap too. I might as well just push a button while I'm there to turn it on.  Wish I could give 0 stars!",6

"September 30, 2017",Dr. Dan,1,Horrible. Would connect to fridge and show in my devices but then the app would say the fridge was not turned on and it would not connect. Tried ten times and them dropped the device and registered it again and still would not connect.,2

force LG to comply with the rules or to get their products banned in the 
EU. My mobile phone operator and my location are none of your business, LG.

"August 29, 2017",Eddie H,2,"Figured it out with my washing machine, but the instructions are unclear and vague. I searched online for answers and found nothing until I read the LG support replies to the negative reviews. Here is what I did:  1. Make sure NFC, WiFi, and Bluetooth are all enabled on your phone and your phone is close to the power button of the washing machine.   2. Start the phone app first and have it ready at the waiting to connect screen.   3. Turn on the washing machine and immediately hold the ""*Wi-Fi"" button for 3 seconds (the WiFi button doesn't work if the machine has been on for a while)   4. The knob of the washing machine should have the checkered glow pattern during this entire process and the red WiFi light symbol should turn on after you held the button.  5. The phone should still be close to the power button of the washer and the phone app should detect the machine pretty quickly. (If it still can't detect it, try using a different phone. My phone detected it but my wife's phone didn't, different Samsung phones)   6. The phone app will then ask you to give your Wi-Fi login information to the Washing machine. Once that is entered, the product will be registered and you can begin  tinkering with the gimmicky features and diagnostic tools.   It's a shame the phone app didn't provide clear instructions. I wasted a lot of time figuring this out, which is why I am leaving a low review score.",2

We are having problems with the washer not cleaning the clothes since it has almost no water in the washer.

"June 4, 2017",Ero Jasper,1,Permission list is ridiculous for this app. All you want to do is use the NFC tagging to customize what you're doing with the product. Why the hell is there so many permissions? Tired of companies stealing private information to resell to third parties. That is the only reason they have so many permission requirements. It's even hilarious how they block you from using the app if you don't allow the permissions. No meta data is absolutely anonymous. GPS data especially. Do not install this app and grant those permissions.,7
"June 8, 2017",Lloyd Compton,1,I paid extra for the ability to have a washer and dryer connected to my network so that we can tell where the process is at for washing and drying. I tried many times to get this to work I called customer support many times and they have no clue as to how it should work LG is failing the customer and the consumer with non-functional application. I will rate the LG washer and dryer as one star on every single website I go to and I will explain that LG can't make their application work.,1

I can download ONE custom wash setting, but the list you choose from doesn't describe the setting so it's just a guessing game.  And supposedly the app will tell me when it's time to run the drum clean cycle, but in order for it to know that I would have to take off my phone cover and tap my phone again so it can count how many wash cycles we've been through, and I just don't think I'll bother.

I have used other apps like this to manage devices in my home, and the entire point is the convenience of not having to be directly in front of the device.
